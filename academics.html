            <h3>Relevant Coursework:</h3>
            <h4>Computer Science I</h4>
            <p>A semester long course in python which covered topics such as: expression of algorithms in pseudo code
                and a programming language; functional and imperative programming techniques; control structures;
                problem solving using recursion; basic searching and sorting; elementary data structures such as lists,
                trees, and graphs; and correctness, testing and debugging. </p>
            <h4>Computer Science II</h4>
            <p>A semester long course in Java which covered topics such as: more information on tree and graph
                structures, nested data structures, objects, classes, inheritance, interfaces, object-oriented
                collection class libraries for abstract data types , and static vs. dynamic data types. Concepts of
                object-oriented design are a large part of the course. Software qualities related to object orientation,
                namely cohesion, minimal coupling, modifiability, and extensibility, are all introduced in this course,
                as well as a few elementary object-oriented design patterns. Input and output streams, graphical user
                interfaces, and exception handling are covered.  </p>
            <h4>Honors Introduction to Computer Science Theory</h4>
            <p>his course provides a challenging introduction to the theory of computation with an emphasis on problem
                solving. Topics include formal languages, grammars, auto-mata theory, computability, and complexity.</p>
            <h4>Mechanics of Programming</h4>
            <p>A semester long course taught in the C programming language in which students will be introduced to the
                details of program structure and the mechanics of execution as well as supportive operating system
                features. Security and performance issues in program design will be discussed. The program translation
                process will be examined</p>
            <h4>Concepts of Computer Systems</h4>
            <p>An introduction to the hardware and software organization of computer systems. The course emphasizes
                a multilevel model of computer organization. Topics include the digital logic level; the micro
                architecture level; the machine instruction set level; the operating system level; and the assembly
                language level. </p>
            <h4>Analysis of Algorithms</h4>
            <p>This course provides an introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms. It covers a variety of
                classical algorithms and data structures and their complexity and will equip students with the
                intellectual tools to design, analyze, implement, and evaluate their own algorithms.</p>
            <h4>Principles of Data Management</h4>
            <p>This course provides a broad introduction to the principles and practice of modern data management,
                with an emphasis on the relational database model. Topics in relational database systems include data
                modeling; the relational model; relational algebra; Structured Query Language (SQL); and data quality,
                transactions, integrity and security. Students will also learn approaches to building relational
                database application programs. Additional topics include object-oriented and object-relational
                databases; semi-structured databases (such as XML); and information retrieval.</p>
            <h4>Programming Language Concepts</h4>
            <p>This course is a study of the syntax and semantics of a diverse set of high-level programming
                languages. The languages chosen are compared and contrasted in order to demonstrate general
                principles of programming language design and implementation. The course emphasizes the concepts
                underpinning modern languages rather than the mastery of particular language details.</p>
